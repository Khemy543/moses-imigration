                        Canada has various pathways of immigration that are suitable ways of immigration to many people from across the world. Therefore, Canada has many streams of immigration, but among the most popular streams of immigration are the following:

                        <ol>
                            <li>Economy Classes</li>
                            <li>Family Class</li>
                            <li>Refugee Class</li>
                            <li>Temporary Residence Class</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <div> Economy Classes: <br>
                                    <p> Skilled Worker Programs: These programs comprise various Federal and Provincial programs that are aimed at admitting qualified and experienced skilled workers from different parts of the world. At the federal level, there are three main categories under one program called <b>EXPRESS ENTRY</b> – A Program run by the Canadian government to fill labour shortage gaps through processing permanent residence application for qualified applicants:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) – Please put link to this website: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html</li>
                                        <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC) – Please put link to this website: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/canadian-experience-class.html</li>
                                        <li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP) – Please put link to this website:  https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/skilled-trades.html</li>
                                    </ul><br> <br>
                                    <p>
                                        At the provincial level, there are also Skilled Worker Programs; <br>

                                        In Canada, each province has its own immigration program aimed at filling labor shortages in each province. Each province, in agreement with the federal government, outlines its own immigration program. Some provides apply methods that are similar to the Federal Express Entry methods to select qualified skilled workers, others follow similar or different paths in trying to fill their labor needs. <br> <br>

                                        If we take the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program as an example; (see here: https://immigratemanitoba.com/immigrate-to-manitoba/), the province has Skilled Worker Program, International Education, and Business Program.
                                    </p>

                            </li>
                            <li>Family Class: Based on the definitions provided on IRPA and IRPR (S. 117), Family Class of immigration comprises a path of sponsorships aimed at unifying families – a foundational infrastructure in the Canadian immigration system. Unlike many countries, Canada’s foundation of immigration is aimed at bringing families together – families that have been dispersed or divided because of political, social, cultural or other factors relevant to the regulations (click here to lern particularities of this program).</li>
                            <li>Refugee Class: Canada has a very generous system of refugee sponsorship programs. This program is designed to help Canadian families to sponsor and bring their loved ones to live in the healthy and peaceful environment Canadian social environment. As a matter of fact, Canada is among the very few countries which understands the ordeals of becoming a refugee, and that it takes a lion’s share in the global resettlement of refugees. Canadian refugee system is based on the global definition of a “refugee” as outlined in the Geneva Convention of 1952 which was revisited in 1967 UNO Protocol.<br> A refugee is “a person who has fled his or her own country and cannot return due to fear of persecution and has been given refugee status”. Refugee status is given to applicants by the United Nations or by a third party country of residence. In the modern world in which various forms of persecution are paramount, Canada remains among the very few global community actors which deeply sympathizes with refugees and their cause. But this is only if their definition of refugee status based on the IRPR and IRPA is consistent. <br>It has to be noted that Canadian Refugee Class of immigration has been encountering a lot of changes in the course of the last eight or so years. Canada allowed Communities to sponsor their refugee members of both nuclear and extended family members through a program broadly known as Private Sponsorship Program (PSR). However, this has changed recently, and Canadian family or friends who would like to sponsor their refugee family members through the PSR have been asked to demonstrate financial capability that they could show either through their income or large amount of trust account deposits. It is a public knowledge that this requirement has been creating remarkable pressure on Canadian community members who would be desperate to save their loved ones from the shackles of desperation, persecution, refugee camps that are infested with outlaws (such as human traffickers), and more.</li>
                            <li>Temporary Residence Class: This class is concerned with temporary residence permit (as authorized by the visa officer at the Port of Entry). The most popular permits in this category are Super Visa, Visitors’ Visa and Tourist Visa. Again, Canada is among the very few countries next to the U.S.A. which allows visit of, among others, parents and grandparents to their permanent resident or Canadian Citizen Children. Parents or grandparents whose children are living in Canada as Permanent Residents or Citizens are allowed to come to Canada as temporary residents so long they meet the requirements. In addition, Canada, as among the most naturally rich countries of the world, it welcomes tourists, visitors or anyone who would love to transit through Canada. Therefore, temporary residence permit comprises part of the most important immigration streams.</li>
